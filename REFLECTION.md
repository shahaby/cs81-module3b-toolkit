## What patterns or surprises did you notice?

The biggest pattern I noticed is how functions can be reused. For example in case of isEven and isOdd we can just write the logic for one of them and use it in the body of the other and just negate the output.

## What logic challenged your thinking?

It's always challenging to predict edge cases, but luckily for this project thanks to the project's simplicity and JavaScript's robust logic I didn't have to think too hard. The only edge cases I can think if is invalid inputs, for example non-numeric values, but since input validation wasn't required for this assignment I ignored it.

## How might this kind of toolkit be used in the real world?

This kind of math toolkit can be very useful in many real-world applications. For example, as a library for web applications that need math calculations.
